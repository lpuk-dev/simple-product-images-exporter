Export all WooCommerce product images to a custom folder and download as a zip.

== Description ==

SPIE is a WordPress plugin that allows you to export all product images to a custom folder.
It's useful when you need to import products from a WordPress website to another, you need a complete folder with all the images for a feed or you need to create a backup of all the images.

Image names will be generated using the product name (sanitized with all special chars replaced with a _), the image index and the image name.

Yes. Use the "Delete Folder" button to delete the folder.
